[section Error Handler]

By default, primer uses the `debug.traceback` function as the error handler
when it uses `pcall`. This means that lua errors which primer encounters will
be nicely formatted for you by the time they are returned as `primer::error`.

If you want to use a customized error handler, there is a simple interface
that you can use to install one. Primer will then use it everywhere.
