How to build the documentation
==============================

1. Install b2 (bjam) if you have not already.  
2. Install [boostbook](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boostbook/getting/started.html)  
3. Install [quickbook](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/quickbook/install.html)  
4. Run b2 from this directory  

All of these may be done by downloading a recent copy of boost, and building things in the tools directory thereof.  

Good luck!
