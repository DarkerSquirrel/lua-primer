[section Userdata]

userdata types are recognized using a trait, `primer::traits::userdata`.
This trait must be specialized for any type which primer will recognize as userdata, and this must provide

* `static const char * name`: A name associated to the userdata. The metatable will be constructed using `luaL_newmetatable`,
  using this name as the key. This name may also be displayed in certain error messages, e.g. if userdata of this type was expected and not found.

* `static const luaL_Reg * methods`: A null-terminated list of metamethods for this userdata. This must include a `__persist` metamethod, or the
  userdata cannot be persisted correctly. See eris' documentation.

* `static const luaL_Reg * other_functions`: A null-terminated list of other functions related to this userdata which must be listed in the permanent
  objects table. Commonly this list contains constructors or other functions related to the type and exposed to the user or via the `__persist` metamethod.

`primer::push_udata` is a template function which is used to construct new userdata objects on the stack.

`push_udata` expects the userdata type as an explicit template parameter, and forwards all arguments to the constructor.

```
  template <typename T, typename... Args>
  void push_udata(lua_State * L, Args && ... args);
```

While primitive types like `number`, `string`, and `table` are generally read from the lua stack by value, as C++ primitives or containers, for userdata types this is usually much less useful.

Instead, userdata types are generally read from the stack *by reference*.

TODO


[h4 Adapting userdata methods]

`PRIMER_ADAPT_USERDATA` is an extension of `PRIMER_ADAPT` which handles member functions of a userdata type.

Functions thus adapted expect to be called using the standard `object:method(arg1, arg2)` syntax in lua, meaning that
the base `object` is actually the first element on the stack.

This is convenient because sometimes its a little nicer to implement userdata methods as C++ methods rather than free
functions. `PRIMER_ADAPT` can only directly handle free functions.
